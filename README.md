# Login & Registration:
The loyalty system offers customers the ability to log in using their
existing credentials or register for a new account. This process ensures
personalized interactions and enables customers to access the loyalty
program's features.
# Dashboard & Profile:
Once logged in, customers are presented with an intuitive and user-
friendly dashboard. The dashboard displays essential information such
as their current loyalty points balance, tier level, and any ongoing
promotions or exclusive rewards. Additionally, customers can access
and manage their profile information, allowing them to update contact
details or preferences.
# History:
The loyalty system maintains a comprehensive transaction history for
each customer. This history provides a detailed record of all loyalty
point-related activities, including points earned through purchases,
redemptions, sharing with others, and any bonus points accrued from
specific promotions or actions. Customers can easily review their past
transactions and track their progress within the loyalty program.
# Tier Level:
The loyalty system employs a tiered structure, categorizing customers
based on their level of engagement and spending. As customers
accumulate more loyalty points over time, they progress through
different tiers. Each tier offers increasing benefits and rewards,
motivating customers to reach higher tiers to unlock more exclusive
perks.

# Pay Point:
The loyalty system rewards customers with loyalty points for their
eligible transactions. Points are typically earned based on the total
amount spent or specific actions completed, such as referring friends,
participating in surveys, or engaging with the brand on social media.
The more customers engage with the brand, the more points they earn
# Claim Point:
As customers accumulate loyalty points, they have the opportunity to
redeem these points for various rewards. The loyalty program's
redemption catalog may include discounts, vouchers, free products,
exclusive experiences, or entry into special events. Customers can
choose to claim rewards that best align with their preferences and
interests.
# Point Sharing:
The loyalty system fosters a sense of community by allowing
customers to share their earned loyalty points with friends or family
members. This feature encourages social engagement and can lead
to increased customer referrals as users share their positive
experiences with the loyalty program.
# Terms and Rules:
Transparent terms and rules are an integral part of the loyalty system.
Customers can access and review the program's terms and conditions,
which outline how loyalty points are earned, redeemed, shared, and
any associated expiration policies. Clear communication of these rules
builds trust and ensures customers have a clear understanding of how
the program operates.
# Notification:
The loyalty system provides customers with timely notifications to keep
them informed about their loyalty point balance, tier upgrades,
upcoming promotions, and special events. Notifications can be
delivered through various channels, including email, SMS, or in-app
messages, ensuring customers stay engaged and aware of program
updates.
# Support:
A dedicated support system is in place to assist customers with any
queries or issues related to the loyalty program. Customer support
representatives are available to answer questions, resolve concerns,
and provide guidance on maximizing the benefits of the loyalty system.
